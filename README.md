COMS W4701 Artificial Intelligence Programming HW 3: Bayesian Classification of Spam Text Messages

### Objective
Using a Beyesian Classifier, determine whether a text message is spam or not (labeled as "ham" in the datasets). The dataset is split into three parts. A training set to train our classifier on, a validation set to adjust parameters, and a test set to test the the classifier. The stop words file was provided by our professor but any stop words files in the same format can be used.

### Outcome
See the commented sections at the top of the python file for degree of success. Overall, the classifier worked very well.

### How To Run
To train the model and evaluate it on the validation set, use:
```
python classifier.py train.txt  dev.txt
```
Once the model's parameters are fine tuned using the validation set, use the following to train and evaluate on the test set:
```
python classifier.py train.txt  test.txt
```

### Dataset
